# Testing and debugging

Besides common debugging features that should be familiar to IntelliJ IDEA users, there are some tools that have been designed 
specifically for Dart and Flutter. Some of them run in background, like the Dart Analyzer tool, so you do not need to run the
``flutter analyze`` command. Thus, your code is being analyzed and the IDE points out possible mistakes and issues for you. Other new 
tools, for instance, include **Flutter Inspector** and **Observatory**. You can use them to test, analyze, and debug your application.

## Debug Mode
To run your application in the Debug Mode, click the <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/6_debug_icon.png" alt="Debug" width="18"/> icon in the upper-right corner of the main IDE window. This mode includes all debugging information, enables Observatory and service extensions. Now you can use the **Debugger** to view the data on frames and variables.

## Flutter Inspector

Widgets are used as the core building blocks in Flutter (everything-is-a-widget concept), so it was important to provide developers with 
a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring widget trees, which might get quite complex. **Flutter Inspector** is the 
tool that helps to visualize, explore, and debug Flutter UIs. It helps to manage bidirectional mapping between an active Flutter UI and 
the corresponding visualization of the widgets tree and the Render Tree. Such approach allows you to follow this mapping into the source 
itself, so you can actually see where in the code (whether it is your code or the the framework code) a widget is being created or 
configured. The **Flutter Inspector** displays widgets that were created directly in your application in Bold, so it is easier for you to distinguish between widgets created in the app and in the framework.

This way, even the huge widgets tree can be handled in an elegant way: selecting a widget of your interest helps both to 
navigate at ease and to save time.   

So, you have your application running and you want to inspect it, check the layouts, widgets, and performance. To open the tool, 
click **Flutter Inspector** on the right side of the main IDE window (alternatively, you can choose **View | Tool Windows | Flutter 
Inspector**). Use the toolbar to interact with elements of an app and to switch between Inspector tabs:

</p>

The following features are at your disposal: 

### Select Widget Mode
To activate this mode click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_select_widget_mode.png" alt="Select Widget Mode" width="18"/> button. Now you can select a widget that you are interested in, so when you interact with your device, you are not interacting with the application directly, but you can see which widget is responsible for a specific position on the screen. Now you can see the tree of widgets, the widget's position, and its properties. 
>**Tip:** hover over a property value to see the list of allowed values. When you perform a hot reload, the Inspector will update the widget properties accordingly.

### Refresh Widget Info
Click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_refresh.png" alt="Refresh Widget Info" width="18"/> button to update the widget information that is displayed in Flutter Insptector. The widget tree will show the selected widget in case if you have scrolled the list to another position.  

### Debug Paint
Use the **Debug Paint** mode to understand how your widgets are laid out on the screen. Click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_debug_paint.png" alt="Debug Paint" width="18"/> button to activate this mode.

</p>

### Platform Mode
Click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_platform_mode.png" alt="Platform Mode" width="18"/> button to activate this mode and switch between Android and iOS platform rendering to test platform-specific rendering without having to use two devices.

### Performance Overlay
The performance overlay displays the GPU & CPU threads performance graphs and allows you to analyze the current situation and improve the performance. Basically, if you are not astisfied with how smooth your application works, this tool should help. Click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_performance_overlay.png" alt="Performance Overlay" width="18"/> button to enable this feature. Now you can test your application and check the performance statistics on the screen.

</p>

## Timeline 
Timeline is a tool that is useful for debugging performance issues: it allows you to capture the stack snapshot. This feature works in tandem with Observatory.

## Observatory
Observatory is a debugging and profiling tool that provides profiling, examining the heap, and displaying code coverage. To open **Observatory**, you must run your application and click <img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_observatory_button.png" alt="Observatory" width="18"/> button (it is available in the **Run** or **Flutter Inspector** tool windows). Use **Observatory** to look inside a running Dart virtual machine and to get the current statistics about memory leaks, check which lines of code have been executed, and so on.

To see the rest of features provided by Flutter Inspector, click the gear-wheel icon in the upper-right corner of the tool window.

### Baseline Painting
Enable this feature to see the baselines paintings in your Flutter application: each RenderBox will paint a line at its baseline.

</p>

### Repaint Rainbow
This feature enables showing the rotating colors on layers when repainting. It helps to understand which areas of the screen are being repainted, and which are not. 

### Enable Slow Animations
Slow your animations down and perform a visual inspection in case if something is not animating properly.

### Hide Debug Banner
If you want to take a screenshot of your new application, hide the "Debug" banner that is displayed in the upper-right corner by default. This feature allows to do it without rebuilding the application.

### Auto Horizontal Scroll
Enabling this feature might be useful if your widget structure is deep. When you scroll down, the IDE will pefrorm the horizontal scroll for you automatically.

### Highlight nodes displayed in both trees
When this feature is enabled, the nodes that are displayed in two panes of Flutter Inspector will be highlighted. 
<p align="center">

</p>

## Render Tree Tab
In case if there is a problem with rendering of a UI element, you can switch to the **Render Tree** tab. Note that the **Widgets** and **Render Tree** tabs are connected, which means that if you have selected a widget and switch between tabs, you will get the data about the same widget. 
>**Tip:** If you have animations in your application, the Render Tree will display the values being changed on-the-fly.

## Dart Analysis Tool Window

This tool window allows to monitor issues that might arise during the project development. The performance of this feature is based on the [Dart Analysis server](https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/content/tool-windows.md#dart-analysis-tool-window), a local server that provides the essential data and functionality for the IDE: code completion, structure view, warnings, syntax highlighting and so on.

In the the **Dart Analysis** tool window you can:
  * Sort the errors by severity or location.
  * Group errors by severity.
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_dart_analysis_1.gif" alt="" width="590"/></p>
 
 * Use the **Dart Problems Filter** to filter out some error messages if necessary.
 <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img_final/5_dart_analysis_2.gif" alt="" width="590"/></p>
 
  * Determine the precise location of an issue and navigate to it.
  * Identify the type of an issue (there can be errors, warnings, or hints).
  * Enable the **Autoscroll to Source** feature that allows to get to the issue in a quick way.
  * Restart the Dart Analysis Server.
