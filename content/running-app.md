# Running your app

## Prerequisites

To run and test your application you must have either a connected device or a configured virtual device. You can check the status in the
**Flutter Device Selection** field in the upper-right corner of the main IDE window. In case if you have not added a device yet, you can 
do it with the help of the **Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager**. To open it choose **Tools | Android | AVD Manager** on the main tool 
bar. You can create and configure a new virtual device that will be used for running your application. If you need to use the iOS 
simulator, make sure that your Xcode SDK is installed and configured properly. Alternatively, you can use a physical device. To check the 
connection use the ``flutter doctor`` command in the console: it will provide you with the data on your environment.

## Running application

To run your application and check its look-and-feel and performance, use the buttons in the upper-right corner of the main IDE window. 

![Run Toolbar](https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/img/5_run_app_toolbar.png)

- You can build your project, either by clicking a hammer button or by using the the ``Ctrl+F9`` (Win, Linux) or ``⌘F9`` (Mac OS) 
shortcuts.	
- Select the device that you want to use for running your app in the **Flutter Device Selection** field. 
- Configure your Run/Debug options. You can actually perform a fine tuning: set the entrypoint for your application, set additional 
command-line arguments, manage build flavor, and add tasks that should run before the launch.
- Run the project (use the ``Shift+F10`` (Win, Linux) or ``^R`` (Mac OS) shortcuts).
- Run the project in the **Debug mode** and study the console output to make adjustments, if necessary (use the ``Shift+F9`` (Win, Linux) 
or ``^D`` (Mac OS) shortcuts).
- You can also run your application with coverage to see and study the coverage measurement results. To check the current coverage 
configuration press ``Ctrl+Alt+S`` (Win, Linux) or ``⌘,`` (Mac OS) to open the **Settings** dialog and go to **Build, Execution, 
Deployemnt | Debugger | Coverage**.
- Click the **Profile** button to launch your application in a profile mode. You need this in case if you are using **Observatory** (a 
debugging and profiling tool shipped with the Dart SDK) for profiling your application.
- **Flutter Hot Reload** allows to apply the latest changes in a quick and easy way. Press ``Ctrl+Back Slash`` (Win, Linux) or ``⌘\`` 
(Mac OS) to view the changes implemented in the app right away.
- If necessary, you can attach a debugger to your application process.
- Stop the application.
