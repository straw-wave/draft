# Tool Windows

When you work on Flutter projects, IntelliJ IDEA offers you Flutter and Dart-specific tool windows that help you to control the 
development process. Widgets are the core building blocks in Flutter (everything-is-a-widget concept), so it was important to provide 
developers with tools for visualizing and exploring widget trees, managing widgets efficiently, and ensuring that the structure is 
correct. Flutter runs on Dart, so delivering the proper code analysis was a crucial point as well. As a result, the code analysis is 
performed automatically, displaying the messages for you in a special tool window.

## Flutter Outline Tool Window

The Flutter Outline tool window helps to work with Flutter widgets and shows your project's widget hierarchy, so you can see the actual 
association between parent and child widgets. However, you can not only check the structure, but modify it as well. To open the 
tool, click Flutter Outline on the right side of the main IDE window. Alternatively, you can choose **View | Tool Windows | Flutter Outline** on the main menu.

## Flutter Inspector Tool Window 

Widgets are used as the core building blocks in Flutter (everything-is-a-widget concept), so it was important to provide developers with 
a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring widget trees, which might actually get really busy. And Flutter Inspector is exactly the 
tool that helps to visualize, explore, and debug Flutter UIs. It helps to manage bidirectional mapping between an active Flutter UI and 
the corresponding visualization of the widget tree and the Render Tree. Such approach allows you to follow this mapping into the source 
itself, so you can actually see where in the code (whether it is your code or the the framework code) a widget is being created or 
configured. This way, even the huge widgets tree can be handled in an elegant way: selecting a widget of your interest helps both to 
navigate at ease and to save time.

## Dart Analysis Tool Window

This tool window allows to monitor issues that might arise during the project development. The performance of this feature is based on 
the Dart Analysis server, a local server (shipped as a part of the Dart SDK) that provides the essential data and functionality for the
IDE: code completion, structure view, warnings, syntax highlighting and so on.

## Run Tool Window

This tool window displays output that has been generated by your application, and it should be well-known developers who know 
IntelliJ IDEA. However, the Flutter plugin delivers some changes: you can find the **Flutter Hot Reload** and **Flutter Hot Restart** 
buttons that have been added to this window. Also such Dart-specific tools as **Observatory** (it displays code coverage, examines the 
heap, and provides profiling) and **Timeline** (it allows you to capture the stack snapshot) are within reach. You can open the Flutter 
Inspector tool from the Run tool window as well.

**Next:** These tools should facilitate the development process. Let us take a look at the [features](https://github.com/straw-wave/draft/blob/master/content/working-on-flutter-code.md) that IntelliJ IDEA provides Flutter developers with and figure out the ways you can speed up the applications building.
